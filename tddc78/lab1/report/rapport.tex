\section{Introduction}

The problem consists of implementing and parallelizing two image filters using OpenMPI. The first filter is a blurfilter that for each pixel calculates a average colour for the surrounding pixels. The other is a threshold filter that calculates the average intensity of the whole picture and makes all pixels above the average black and those below white.

\section{Method}
\subsection{Blur filter algorithm}
\begin{algorithm}[H]

\end{algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}[H]

\label{alg:Slave}
\begin{algorithmic}
\Procedure{Slave}{}

\State Calculate which part of the image to work on
\State Receive part of the image using MPI\_Recv

\State Create part of the image
\State Send part of image back using MPI\_Send
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Design}
The image is split up by rows to utilize the space locality of the data and the data in both cases are accessed row wise for improved spatial locality. For example in the blur filter the pixelvalue is not calculated for each radius but for each row. If it was calculated for each radius that meant that we jump in the memory and the probability for cache misses is greater.


\section{Result}
The blur filter scales well and hits the lower time limit at around 31 cores with an improvement compared to a single core of 15 times faster. After 31 cores the calculation time starts to increase. This could be because each cores does to little work so much of the time is spent sending data to all cores.
\\
\\
The threshold filter scales rather poorly. The cause for this is probably because the calculation is not that intense. Each core just has to go through all pixels and add together their values which can be done very quickly so most of the time of the calculation is spent on sending data to the cores. This algorithm should be done on a single core.
