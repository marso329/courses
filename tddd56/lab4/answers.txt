PART 1:
QUESTION: How many cores will simple.cu use, max, as written? How many SMs?
16 because we use 16 blocks and each thread can migrate to one block

QUESTION: Is the calculated square root identical to what the CPU calculates? Should we assume that this is always the case?
No the precision is different

QUESTION: How do you calculate the index in the array, using 2-dimensional blocks?
	int x=blockDim.x*blockIdx.x+threadIdx.x;
	int y=blockDim.y*blockIdx.y+threadIdx.y;
