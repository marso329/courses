QUESTION: How much data did you put in local (shared memory?

36*36*3 ints=12288 bytes
Because each work item works on 32*32 pixels but needs to access pixels 2 steps outside this

QUESTION: How much data does each thread copy to local memory?

4 pixels = 4*3=48 bytes

QUESTION: How did you handle the necessary overlap between the work groups?
copying more than needed, this is no problem because we are not dependent of data from other work groups

QUESTION: If we would like to increase the block size, about how big work groups would be safe to use in this case? Why?

That depends on how much local memory we have. Let say we have 4k of local memory and a int is 4 bytes. We can store 1000 ints

x*x*3*4=4096->x=18

we have 1024 cores to we could have 32x32 instead of 16x16

 QUESTION: How much speedup did you get over the naive version?
 not measured yet
