Write a detailed explanation why computation load can be imbalanced and how it
affects the global performance:

A black pixel requires maxiter iterations to be calculated. So in the naive parallel implementation the
thread(s) that get to calculate the middle part of the picture will get more work.


Describe a load-balancing method that would help reducing the performance loss
due to load-imbalance:

The picture is split up into a 10x10 grid and a counter with lock is implemented. Each threads grabs a 
number and increases the counter by one. From the counter, picture width and picture height the pixels
that will be calculated can be extracted. When the counter reaches 100 all threads are done.
