1.
What kind of data does the heightmap image data hold? What range is the heightmap data?
grayscale 0-255

The terrain is 4x4. How many polygons does it draw?
18st 

Did you need to extend your camera movement code? How?
yes, i extended it so that the camera looks at a point above the ground all the time,


3.
How did you implement the cross product? Function call, inline...? Normalization? 
CalcNormalVector

Which method did you use to find the normal vector? 
three neighbor vertices

4.
How did you figure out what surface to use? 
Normalized the x and z values and checked which side of the line in the quad the point was

How did you calculate the height from the surface? 
three points->normal
normal+one point=plane equation
solve for y with the x and z values given

5.
Objects with terrain dependent slope 

Camera movement

Multitextured terrain

multiple objects(without collision detection)
