\section{checklist}
\subsection{problem formulation}
The presentation of the problem is clearly formulated, demarcated and realistic; it is also
adapted to degree projects at this educational level.
\newline
Answer: The presentation of the problem is clear, the problem is that the solutions seems to only apply for one codebase which is a 2d-game. I am unsure about if it adapts to the educational level, this seems not much more complicated than a bachelor thesis.

Answer: according to the author most of the sources are best sellers and influent people, this does not necessarily men scientific references 
\newline
\newline
The student’s work is clearly linked to established scientific theories and concepts.
\newline
Answer:
Well no, they may by established theories but not neccesarily established scientific theories.
\newline
\newline
The references are related to and evaluated on the basis of the student’s presentation of
the problem and the student’s results and conclusions.
\newline
Answer: Have not read results and conclusions yet
\subsection{Execution and Scientific Approach}
The report shows that the student uses established scientifically relevant methods, has an
understanding of their limitations, and justifies the choice of methods.
\newline
Answer: the problem is "scientifically" but yes
\newline
\newline
The report shows that the student has the ability to use and integrate the knowledge and
skills that have been acquired during his/her education, as well as the ability to
independently acquire other knowledge or skills necessary to solve the problem.
\newline
Answer:Yes
\newline
\newline
The report shows that the student systematically describes how he/she reaches the results
and conclusions based on the chosen method and the given preconditions.
\newline
Answer:Yes
\newline
\newline
The report shows that the student has the ability to model, design as well as analyse or
evaluate products/systems/methods/processes/theories in a professional manner.
\newline
answer: Yes
\subsection{Results and Conclusions}
The report shows that the student produces relevant results, draws adequate conclusions
and critically reviews the relevance and limitations of these results and conclusions.
\newline
\newline
The report shows that the student has substantial theoretical understanding of his/her
results and conclusions.
\newline
\newline
The report shows that the student can make assessments with respect to relevant societal
needs and can take into consideration ethical aspects.
\subsection{Precision in Communication}
The report is written so that a reader at the same educational level and in the same main
field of study can grasp and understand the contents.
\newline
Answer: Yes but there are a lot of new subjects that you might need to read up on to grasp some parts.
\newline
\newline
The title and the abstract describe the topic of the degree project in a manner that is both
informative and attracts the reader’s interest.
\newline
Answer: Not my interest but certainly some persons
\newline
\newline
The report’s outline and headings are clear and informative.
\newline
Answer: yes
\newline
\newline
The central parts of the report, such as problem formulation, the method, and the results,
are easy to find.
\newline
Answer: yes
\newline
\newline
The language is used in a correct manner.
\newline
Answer: Yes
\newline
\newline
The layout and the typography adheres to praxis and facilitates reading.
\newline
Answer: Yes but some mathematical formulas could be formated better
\newline
\newline
Figures and tables with associated captions are informative and self-explanatory.
\newline
Answer: yes but there are a lot of code examples that I find uneccesary
\newline
\newline
Citations and references are used in an adequate manner with regard to the main field of
study.
\newline
Answer: yes
\section{Questions}
    Does the theory cover both techniques relevant to the project and research methods employed in similar work? Is there material that seems superfluous given the research question?	
    \newline
    There is very much information in the theory about 	quality metrics but very little about IoC which is what the thesis is about.
    \newline
    \newline
    Are the references used in the published thesis relevant to support the claim in the thesis? Are they well cited? Are they specific to the claims that they are used to support?
    \newline
    Answer: Yes they are relevent but some are not very scientific. 
     The Mythical Man-Month: enligt In the 25 years since The Mythical Man-Month what have we learned about project management? så har den blivit citerad i genomsnitt 25 gånger per år sedan 1975. 
     A Metrics Suite for Object Oriented Design[6] är citerad 1251 gånger men från 1994. 
     
Refactoring: improving the design of existing code [9] är citerad 977 gånger enligt acm
Working Effectively with Legacy Code[8] är citerad 25 gånger enligt ACM.
Metric based testability model for object oriented design[14] är citerad 5 gånger enligt ACM. 
    \newline
    \newline
    The other references that you found, did you consider them as better suited for the same purpose? Were they newer, more well-cited or a better match for the claims they could support? Do they seem to present similar or different results? How did you find them? Describe these references including how you found them and their abstracts.
    \newline
    Answer: sciencedirect and web of science were used. 
    first reference:

    \newline
    \newline
    Can you check all items from the checklist relevant to the Theory and Method chapters?Justify your answer.
    \newline
    See above, I would not say that all items can be checked of
    \newline
    \newline
    Is it clear that the research question is well-formulated and relevant, based on contents of the Theory chapter?
    \newline
    Answer: yes but I would like to see more theory on IoC. There is also not much theory on refactoring which is a major part of the thesis 
    \newline
    \newline
    Is the method formulated clearly enough that someone else would be able to replicate the study?
    \newline
    No and it seems to be based on not very scientific methods. I would not be able to refactor a codebase using IoC containers after reading the method chapter.
\section{Theory}
3.1:"The software development field has only existed for some 50 years and therefore suffers from some of
the problems expected of such a relatively young discipline." source on that it suffers from this. 50 years might be a relative age. 

"As a result, software development is a field of many practitioners without formal training. The
practices deployed are in many cases based on general experience rather than scientifically verified
knowledge or empirical evidence." source ?
\newline
\newline
3.2:"Code written with test first programming has, if done right, a high quality with regard to design and as
a corollary – high testability. See section 3.3 for a continued discussion of the attribute of testability." source?
\newline
\newline
3.5.1: "Another aspect is speed. Unit tests should be fast enough to be run often. Preferably every time you
compile. They should not take more than 1-2 seconds in total, absolutely not more than 10. Hence,
individual tests should run on a few milliseconds." this is only suggestions and does not belonge in theory.
\newline
\newline
3.5.2: [34] (time: 09:30) weird reference
\newline
\newline
3.7:"According to Martin Fowler [60] Inversion of Control originates
from the “Hollywood Principle” 9 probably introduced by Richard E.
Sweet in [81" you should not use probably in theory
\newline
\newline
3.8.4: "Template injection (TI) is not established terminology but introduced here in this report for the use of
the C++ template engine to inject dependencies. The almost non-existent interest in template injection
could be the lack of general availability or for historical reasons. Java, where DI is most prominent,
did not have generics, the closest to an equivalent, until J2SE 5.0. Another reason could be the
imposed limitations that templates bring. See section 7.1.4 Dependency injection: Preferred Methods
for further discussion on the ramifications of Template injection." could be?


\section{Method}
2.2 literature study: sources relies on best sellers. That does not sound good in my ears.
\newline
\newline
2.3 investigative method. He says he uses method that he discovered first hand. Also says that the refactoring was a trial and error effort which does not give confident in the literal background behind the refactoring.
\newline
\newline
2.4: does not mention which metrics were left out.
\newline
\newline
 2.5: a numbers of profiling tools were used but mentions none.

In [2], Kent Beck outline the following development cycle:
• Add a new test.
• Run all tests and see if any tests fail.
17• If it does, write some code –if not, start over and add another test.
• Run all tests again to verify that the added code makes the test pass.
• Remove duplication, clean up the added code and verify by running the tests again.
• Start over.
The development cycle can also be expressed more compactly as:
• Create a failing test
• Write just enough code to pass the test
• Refactor your code to improve design
This cycle is also known as Red/Green/Refactor. The color reference is to how some unit testing
framework’s IDE plug-ins display failing and passing tests with a red and green bar, respectively [2]
(p. x).
\newline
\newline
The fundamental principle behind the xUnit test pattern is to verify that the class or function under test
are in a specific state, has produced a specific result or has performed a specific task. This is done
using what is called Asserts 7 . As in code example I the Assert verify a specific condition such as that
the actual result equals the expected result. [2] (p. 157)
\newline
Comments: One of the primary sources and used 2 times to give credability to very little having to do with his thesis. His major reason for this source is to reference the algorithm for tdd and on that note this is a good source. If you however were to dig deeper inte tdd Erdogmus, Hakan; Morisio, Torchiano. "On the Effectiveness of Test-first Approach to Programming". Proceedings of the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 31(1). might be a better source since it is a ieee conference publication with reasonable number of citation of 64(ACM) and not a book based on experience and not on theoretical facts.
